# Week 6 Examples (Timer Ports)


## Example 1

PWM signal with 50% duty cycle on Channel B of timer0 (Fast PWM mode and pre-scaler value of 64)

## Example 2 

PWM signal with 50% duty cycle on Channel B of timer0 (Fast PWM mode and pre-scaler value of 1)

## Example 3

PWM signal with 50% duty cycle on Channel B of timer0 (Fast PWM mode, pre-scalervalue of 1, top value of 5)


## Example 4

PWM signal with 25% duty cycle on Channel A of timer1 (10-bit Phase Correct PWM-mode and pre-scalervalue of 8)
